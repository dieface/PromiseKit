 The provided block is executed when its receiver is resolved.

 If you provide a block that takes a parameter, the value of the receiver will be passed as that parameter.

 @param block The block that is executed when the receiver is resolved.

 @return A new promise that is resolved with the value returned from the provided block. For example:

    [NSURLConnection GET:url].then(^(NSData *data){

        //…

 @warning *Important* The block passed to `then` may take zero, one, two or three arguments, and return an object or return nothing. This flexibility is why the method signature for then is `id`, which means you will not get completion for the block parameter, and must type it yourself. It is safe to type any block syntax here, so to start with try just: `^{}`.

 @warning *Important* If an exception is thrown inside your block, or you return an `NSError` object the next `Promise` will be rejected. See `catch` for documentation on error handling.
